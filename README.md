In one of my favourite Lionel Messi games in the UEFA Champions League, showcasing not only his immaculate understanding of the game, but the team's chemistry, this project analyses Messi’s performance against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley during the 2018/19 group stage. Some of his events that were looked at were his:

- 🔮 Dribbles
- ⚽️ Goals
- ✅ Successful Passes
- 🥅 Shots on Target
- ❌ Shots off Target(having hit the same woodwork twice)

⏳The flagship project is almost done. I just need to fully event tag the second game and create heatmaps of the players that had a rating above 7 or had a goal contribution, then we are good to go.
